                    extraHTML="<p>
                        Lingo is a non-euclidean rule discovery word puzzle game. If you already know what lingo is, then welcome back! If not, we've tried to keep this as spoiler free as possible.<br>
                        The Lingo maps we've made so far are: Thenonymous Garden, Chain*, Perspectives, Landgreen, Lingeo, The Smiley Narrative, Desert Cacti, The Cookie Gutter, Misrememberry Tutorial, Entri, Qe Temple, The Linguide, Resting Place (with daniyar942) and Thursday Collection.<br>
                        *Chain is really bad and isn't on the steam workshop don't play it.</p>

                        <h3>Thenonymous Garden</h3>
                        <p>Our first map! Contains a lot of miscellaneous ideas without too much of a central theme.<br>
                        When we made this though we used the wrong colour for lavender so then had to go through every puzzle using it and then replace it with the correct lavender. After that we still missed one block and then got a new computer before someone noticed it and we didn't save a backup so now there's one block which should be lavender but isn't which will be in the map forever...<br>
                        Thenonymous Garden still has the most panels out of any lingo map we've made!</p>
                        <h3>Chain</h3>
                        <p>An attempt to do a puzzle for every possible chain of 2 blocks of the same colour using only vanilla colours. There's no decoration and it's definitely more of a proof of concept than an actual map you should play.</p>
                        <h3>Perspectives</h3>
                        <p>A map all about middle green. Only 18 panels, but several different, often unusual, interpretations of middle green. Also with some mountains in the distance.</p>
                        <h3>Landgreen</h3>
                        <p>Building off of one of the ideas from Thenonymous Garden, Landgreen creates the new colour 'pear'. Or courgette or green tea nobody really knows.<br>Also features some puzzles from other people using the mechanics.</p>
                        <h3>Lingeo</h3>
                        <p>The geography map. Simple decoration and puzzles.</p>
                        <h3>The Smiley Narrative</h3>
                        <p>Heavily inspired by The Stanley Parable, The Smiley Narrative does not have a narrator but is by far the most focussed on navigation out of my maps. The goal is to close every door and trap yourself in your own room.<br>
                        Also a map which we updated, with the new content including the bucket. Overall a very strange experience for the player.</p>
                        <h3>Desert Cacti</h3>
                        <p>Inspired by 2 areas from basegame lingo, we made Desert Cacti with each room expanding upon its respective colour.</p>
                        <h3>The Cookie Gutter</h3>
                        <p>Possibly the map we're most proud of. We planned every puzzle before making the map while away from home, then on returning we built the areas with puzzles along with a labyrinthine underground which is supposed to be required for navigation. (SOMEONE found a way to jump onto the wall to skip that part)<br>
                        The map introduces cookies! They come in multiple flavours: plain cookie, mint cookie, lavender cookie... and they all have different mechanics but they're built upon one core concept which would completely ruin the map if we told you about it!!!<br>
                        The second most brutal but still fair map we've concocted.</p>
                        <h3>Misrememberry Tutorial</h3>
                        <p>Absolute Shitema. It claims to be a tutorial map but we created it like we had forgotten most of the mechanics we wanted to tutorialise and just came up with stuff on the spot. Then upstairs it is just a shitpost with a maze you do not want to spend time in and many inside jokes an- CURSE OF RA<br>
                        and a healthy amount of plagiarism. We find this map really funny and really enjoyed creating it!</p>
                        <h3>Entri</h3>
                        <p>Every puzzle is 3 blocks and we put a lot of effort into this one's decoration. We tried to make it with the intention of it just being a cozy map you'd just play when you want to do something more casual.<br>
                        We also made sure to give the player plenty of space to run about and jump around!</p>
                        <h3>Qe Temple</h3>
                        <p>I used the blockmover script by daniyar942 to make this map and also featured some rule discovery. What the blockmover script does is it lets the player move around specific blocks by pressing Q or E. Each puzzle requires a specific configuration of blocks to be possible.<br>
                        The decoration for this map was also themed around ancient structures, like castles and temples.</p>
                        <h3>The Linguide</h3>
                        <p>The only co-op map made for lingo when we made it. Inspired by Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, one player has their hands on the game and the other player has cryptic instructions open in front of them. They are not allowed to see what each other are doing.<br>
                        Not too proud of this one however as we really rushed it.</p>
                        <h3>Resting Place</h3>
                        <p>A map we made with daniyar942. daniyar did the puzzles and we did the decoration. Since we were only doing the decoration, we went hard with it and the results are by a significant margin the best deco I've done in a lingo map.</p>
                        <h3>Thursday Collection</h3>
                        <p>Only one more map to tell you about, right? No! This is actually 5 or 6 maps depending on how you count it.<br>
                        Footpath: The walking simulator! It's dreamlike.<br>
                        Beforehand: Literally makes you go insane if you play it for too long. It's also kinda rule discovery.<br>
                        Watchtower: Again a small map about middle green but this time it's different.<br>
                        Flipside: A Q/E platformer map.<br>
                        Afterthought: A timed challenge which is randomised each time and only ever has puzzles made by us.<br>
                        Lobby: It's where you choose what map you want to play, but it also has a side room with some really 'interesting puzzles' and an extra little bit that unlocks once you beat all of the other maps.<br>
                        We made music for every map in this collection. Beforehand was intentionally maddening and Afterthought plays a 10-minute song as a countdown in every attempt of the map. Flipside's music goes hard tbh.<br>
                        We also made a trailer for this map! <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yArkyvwTAN8'>Lingo - Map Pack Preview</a></p>
